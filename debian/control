Description: A tool to load and stress a computer.
 stress-ng is a tool that can stress various subsystems
 of a computer. One can load CPU, memory, I/O sync or
 disk.  It is a cleanroom re-write of the original stress
 tool by Amos Waterland but has addition features such as
 specifying the number of bogo operations to run rather
 than running for a specified duration.
