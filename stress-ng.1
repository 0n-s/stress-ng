.SH NAME
stress\-ng \- a tool to load and stress a computer system
.br

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B stress\-ng
[\fIOPTION \fR[\fIARG\fR]] ...
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
stress\-ng will stress test a computer system in various optional ways.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-?, \-\-help
show help
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-all
start N instances of each stress test
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-backoff N
wait N microseconds between the start of each stress process
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-cpu N
start N processes computing sqrt((double)rand())
.TP
.B \-\-cpu\-ops N
stop cpu stress processes after N bogo operations
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-cpu\-load P
load CPU with P percent loading. 0 is effectivly a sleep (no load) and 100 is full
loading.
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-cache N
start N processes that perform memory read and writes to thrash the CPU cache
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-ops N
stop cache thrash processes after N bogo cache thrash operations
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-dry-run
parse options, but don't run stress tests
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-hdd
start N processes continually writing and removing temporary files
.TP
.B \-\-hdd\-bytes N
write N bytes for each hdd process, the default is 1 GB
.TP
.B \-\-hdd\-noclean
do not remove files created by hdd processes
.TP
.B \-\-hdd\-ops N
stop hdd stress processes after N bogo operations
.TP
.B -\F, \-\-fallocate N
start N processes continally fallocating and ftuncating temporary files
.TP
.B \-\-fallocate\-ops N
stop fallocate stress processes after N bogo fallocate operations
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-fork N
start N processes continually forking children that immediately exit
.TP
.B \-\-fork\-ops N
stop fork stress processes after N bogo operations
.TP
.B \-\-flock N
start N processes locking on a single file
.TP
.B \-\-flock-ops N
stop flock stress processes after N goto flock operations
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-io N
start N processes continuously calling sync()
.TP
.B \-\-io\-ops N
stop io stress processes after N bogo operations
.TP
.B \-\-ionice-class class
specify ionice class (only on Linux). Can be idle (default), besteffort, be, realtime, rt.
.TP
.B \-\-ionice-level level
specify ionice level (only on Linux). For idle, 0 is the only possible option. For besteffort or
realtime values 0 (hightest priority) to 7 (lowest priority). See ionice(1) for more details.
.TP
.B \-\-metrics
output number of bogo operations in total performed by cpu, io, vm and hdd processes
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-vm N
start N processes continuously calling mmap()/munmap() and writing to the allocated memory
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-bytes N
mmap N bytes per vm process, the default is 256MB. One can specify the size in units of Bytes,
KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-stride N
write to every Nth byte, the default is every page (4096 bytes). One can specify the size in
units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-ops N
stop vm stress processes after N bogo operations
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-hang N
sleep N seconds before unmapping memory, the default is zero seconds. Specifying 0 will
do an infinite wait
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-keep
don't continually unmap and map memory, just keep on re-writing to it
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-populate
populate (prefault) page tables for the memory mappings; this can stress swapping. Only
available on systems that support MAP_POPULATE (since Linux 2.5.46).
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-pipe N
start N processes that perform large pipe writes and reads to exercise pipe I/O
.TP
.B \-\-pipe\-ops N
stop pipe stress processes after N bogo pipe write operations
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
don't show any output
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-sock N
start N processes that perform various socket stress activity
.TP
.B \-\-sched-scheduler sched
select the named scheduler (only on Linux). To see the list of available schedulers
use: stress\-ng \-\-sched which
.TP
.B \-\-sched\-prio prio
select the scheduler priority level (only on Linux). If the scheduler does not support this then
the default priority level of 0 is chosen.
.TP
.B \-\-sock-port P
start at socket port P. For N socket worker processes, ports P to P - 1 are used.
.TP
.B \-\-sock-ops N
stop socket stress processes after N bogo operations
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-switch N
start N processes that send messages via pipe to a child to force context switching
.TP
.B \-\-switch\-ops N
stop context switcing processes after N bogo operations
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-timeout N
stop stress test after N seconds. One can also specify the units of time in
seconds, minutes, hours, days or years with the suffix s, m, h, d or y
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
show all debug, warnings and normal information output
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
show version
.TP
.B \-y, \-\-yield N
start N process that call sched_yield
.TP
.B \-\-yield\-ops N
stop yield stress processes after N sched_yield bogo operations

stress\-ng was written by Colin King <colin.king@canonical.com> and is a clean
room implementation of the original stress tool by Amos Waterland <apw@rossby.metr.ou.edu>.
Note that the stress-ng cpu, io, vm and hdd tests are different implementations of the original stress
tests and hence may produce different stress characteristics.
