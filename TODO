List of TODO items:

1. acls?
2. point to the stats info per stessor from the
   proc info rather than having some form of 
   baroque lookup index
3. make procs a linked list rather than a fixed
   array to allow us generate a "program" of stressors
   from the jobs info and run them in a specific
   order
